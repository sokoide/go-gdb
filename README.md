# go-gdb

This is *only for go1.4.x*. Please use the official (included) runtime-gdb.py in the go package which doesn't have the problem.

Fixed runtime-gdb.py script for goroutine debugging.
Originally written at http://blog.securitymouse.com/2014/10/golang-debugging-turning-pennies-into-gs.html.

## Note

Checkout appropriate branch and use the same version of the script as your target go version.
It may not work in 32bit process or other OS than OSX/Windows.

## How to use

1. run your debuggee written in go under gdb, or run gdb and attach to it
2. source path-to-runtime-gdb.py
3. info goroutine
4. goroutine $goroutine-id bt

## Samples

```
(gdb) info go
